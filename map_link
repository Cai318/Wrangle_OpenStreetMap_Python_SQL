I chose Yellowstone National Park as my map data to wrangle because it is one of my 
favorite places to visit.

The data used in this analysis is an export from OpenStreetMap.org via Overpass API, 
which is a mirror of OpenStreetMapâ€™s extensive database. 

The map can be found here:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=9/44.6778/-110.8037

From here, I manually selected a different area to better encase only Yellowstone National Park
using these coordinates: 44.0936, -111.1816, 44.8754, -110.0036
